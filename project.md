Title: Project Requirements
Author: Neil Ernst

# Overview
The course project is a semester long effort to apply the ideas behind code reading and communication to a realistic project.

Your team gets to choose the project you will work on (subject to some restrictions). In general the project must be *active* (daily commits), *moderately large* (>100 stars on GH, but not intractably complex), and *open-source*. Since other teams have done this type of course, you cannot select from the [banned project list](). This is to avoid annoying hard-working and under-compensated OSS maintainers.  

## Milestones

- **M0.** team formation and Github (5%)
- **M1.** identify stakeholders (10%)
- **M2.** identify architecturally significant requirements and utility tree (10%)
- **M3.** module view (15%)
- **M4.** C&C view (15%)
- **M5.** assess project quality and debt (10%)
- **M6.** present report (35%)
- **Bonus**: using your knowledge of the project, submit a pull request that improves the project somehow (most likely, by adding useful documentation). (+10%)

## Teams

- Instructor assigned - see Slack
- If you are having trouble with your team (lazy group members, poor communication, technical trouble, etc.) **come see me or Omar as early as possible**. We cannot help you if you don't let us know. Telling me in April that the team was not effective will not be an excuse.
- A regular meeting schedule is highly recommended to keep everyone on track. You might want to follow a [Scrum style standup](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum): each team member says:
    -   What did you do since last meeting?
    -   What will you do before the next meeting?
    -   Are there any impediments in your way?
- You can organize how you wish, but everyone must contribute, and one person should be in charge of overall planning. 

All students are expected to participate equally in discussions, design and development. The instructor will make marking adjustments for individual students where this participation has not occurred; this may result in a failing grade for the project. At the mid-point and conclusion of the project you will be asked to evaluate your colleagues on the team. Your peer review score will influence what percentage of the project mark you get.
