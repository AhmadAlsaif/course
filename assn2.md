Due: **Tues, Apr 10 11:59pm** as a Github commit. We mark the last commit unless told otherwise.

Note:

* Assignments are to be completed individually.
* Format your submission as a Markdown document. 

## Presentation Guidelines

* marks will be deducted if not followed
* First page should be a cover page that indicates your name and student number, title of your project, and a table of contents for the document.
* Include page numbers, i.e. 1 of 10 and your name 
* Include clear section headings that match the assignment description
* Support your assertions with reference to specific lines of code or document sections. Cite this using hyperlinks. For example, "ActionView's [prepare_context](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7ca3ab415d409ba39b07ff5a96da06d68098069b/actionview/lib/action_view/context.rb#L22) method has a potential buffer underflow problem"

# Overview
Conduct a documentation review on a student team document, with report detailing how well the documentation has been completed (e.g., can we answer key stakeholder questions).

You will prepare a review of architecture documentation to assess its suitability to be presented at an architecture review board. This is *not* reviewing the system itself. Instead, you are trying to determine whether or not the set of docs is ready to be shown to management (we don't want to waste time if the document cannot even answer basic QA questions). For our purposes, think of this as assessing the extent to which this document will be *useful* if shown to the project leads or newcomers to the project.

Use the PDF article linked to and the course notes from the Reviewing Documentation lecture to guide your approach. 

# Objectives
* Quality assessment of a software documentation package
* Preparing list of questions assessing documentation quality
* Learning and reading third party code

# Requirements
1. Familiarize yourself with the system you have been assigned, to a cursory level (e.g. read the README, skim project documents).
2. Gather the team document (the MD file).
3. Prepare the review process according to the list on p. 8 of the article:
	1. Establish review purpose (here, the purpose is to assess usefulness to the project leads).
	2. Establish the subject.
	3. Build a question set.
	4. Plan the review (likely a very short phase)
	5. Perform individual review of the team's documents.
	6. Analyze and summarize results in a summary document that is approx 1500 words long. The document should capture your analysis, but also the first 4 steps of this process (purpose, subject, questions).

The outcome of the assignment should be a document detailing the good and bad parts of that team's documentation with respect to answering key quality attribute questions.


# Deliverables
1. The review document, formatted as usual in markdown.
