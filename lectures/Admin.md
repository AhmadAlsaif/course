*This will be an ongoing set of admin notes and policy releases.*


# 1/8/17
- Slack and Github
- Joining and leaving class - do it soon so teams can stabilize
- Behavior - devices are fine, but they should be used for class - Slack, checkng references, etc. Please take convos outside if you have to chat/answer phone/check Facebook. Incidentally I read that the average worker checks social media 3x an hour which is bananas. 
- I want to start on time. If you miss a bus, no problem, but don't make it a habit.
- Mental health and respect. This class will be conducted like I would expect any workplace to function: respect for each other's opinions and ideas. The UVIC and CSC department policies will be applied where necessary.
- There aren't stupid questions. If you come to my office, or ask me in class, I promise to try my best to respect what you are saying and answer no matter what the question. I may not have an answer though.
- Keep in mind that if you need assistance with stuff like getting your laptop working, or understanding Github, we have a CS tutorial office, in addition to me or Omar.
