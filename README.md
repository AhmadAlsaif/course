# Syllabus
Software is a long-lived and complex thing. This course is about understanding software in the large. We use the SEI text as a framework for understanding large-scale software systems. Topics include

* what is architecture? Who are architects?
* what structures are important to understand?
* views on software systems
* software quality attributes
* architecture analysis and recovery
* architecture-driven design
* agile architecture
* design, architecture, and technical debt

(the official course syllabus is [distributed via HEAT](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/outline/201))

## Past versions:

* past deliverables from the TU Delft IN4315 are available at https://delftswa.github.io and https://www.gitbook.com/@delftswa

## Instructors
* [Neil Ernst](http://neilernst.net), instructor. Office ECS 560, office hours TBD.
* Omar Elazhary, teaching assistant

# Course Overview

After the course, students are able to:

* begin to reason about and evaluate software design tradeoffs
* capture software architecture in modern documentation approaches
* work together in teams, with modern software tools.
* use a views and beyond approach to capture software architecture.
* compare and contrast different architectural styles, including product lines, microservices, MVC.
* explain and recognise technical debt.

# Deliverables
The class will use [Github](https://github.com/SENG480-18) and [Slack](https://seng480-s18.slack.com) to work on the project. Students will have to register their Github username (either a permanent one or a throwaway) with the instructors. Those with an objection to using Github please contact the instructor for workarounds. All Github activity is private to the class organization. Please see the privacy notice on the Connex site.

[Slack](https://seng480-s18.slack.com) will be the primary mechanism used for communication in the class. My rationale (apart from being tools used in practice) is to expose the class as a whole to questions about projects, assignment, and lectures. 

University and department policies on professional conduct and integrity are applicable. Feel free to see me in person, or via UVic email, for personal questions.

## Overview
The primary deliverable is a group project worth 50% of the mark. You and your team of 5 will select a software project (e.g., OSS on Github), and document important views on the software. The end result will be a set of documentation about the software system and a deep understanding of how it is constructed.

## Assignment
One individual assignment worth 25% of final mark. Due dates as below. The individual assignment will be to conduct a documentation review session with one other team's docs. 

## Group Project
75% of final mark. Students will be assigned to teams and document an open source software system. Due dates in calendar below.
 
### Project Milestones

## Midterm
No midterm.

## Final
No final.
