# Syllabus
Software is a long-lived and complex thing. This course is about understanding software in the large. We use the SEI text as a framework for understanding large-scale software systems. Topics include

* what is architecture? Who are architects?
* what structures are important to understand?
* views on software systems
* software quality attributes
* architecture analysis and recovery
* architecture-driven design
* agile architecture
* design, architecture, and technical debt

(the official course syllabus is [distributed via HEAT (SENG480a link)](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/outline/2018/Spring/SENG/480A))

SEI Software Architecture in Practice, Len Bass, Paul Clements, Rick Kazman. 3rd Edition. 2013.

## Past versions:

* past deliverables, similar in form to what this course will produce,  from the TU Delft IN4315 course, are available at https://delftswa.github.io and https://www.gitbook.com/@delftswa. These are both modeled on the AOSA book -- http://aosabook.org

## Instructors

* [Neil Ernst](http://neilernst.net), instructor. Office ECS 560, office hours TBD.
* Omar Elazhary, teaching assistant

# Course Overview

After the course, students are able to:

* begin to reason about and evaluate software design tradeoffs
* capture software architecture in modern documentation approaches
* work together in teams, with modern software tools.
* use a views and beyond approach to capture software architecture.
* compare and contrast different architectural styles, including product lines, microservices, MVC.
* explain and recognise technical debt.

# Deliverables
The class will use [Github](https://github.com/SENG480-18) and [Slack](https://seng480-s18.slack.com) to work on the project. Students will have to register their Github username (either a permanent one or a throwaway) with the instructors. Those with an objection to using Github please contact the instructor for workarounds. All Github activity is private to the class organization. Please see the privacy notice on the Connex site.

[Slack](https://seng480-s18.slack.com) will be the primary mechanism used for communication in the class. My rationale (apart from being tools used in practice) is to expose the class as a whole to questions about projects, assignment, and lectures. 

University and department policies on professional conduct and integrity are applicable. Feel free to see me in person, or via UVic email, for personal questions.

## Overview
There is one assignment, a midterm, and a substantial group project. Grad students have one extra assignment to conduct. 

## Assignment
*Undergrads*: One individual assignment worth **25%** of final mark. Due dates as below. 

- for one of the projects in the course, pick a quality attribute, create a quality attribute scenario, and document how the project source code realizes this scenario. Provide discussion on how the project can handle changes in this scenario in the future.

*Grads*: the undergrad assignment, plus 

- a documentation review session on the student document, with report detailing how well the documentation has been completed (e.g., can we answer key stakeholder questions).

## Group Project
The primary deliverable is a group project. You and your team will select a software project (OSS on Github), and document important views on the software. The end result will be a set of documentation about the software system and a deep understanding of how it is constructed. **60%** of final mark. Students will be assigned to teams and document an open source software system. Due dates in calendar below. See [the Project outline](https://github.com/SENG480-18/course/blob/master/project.md).

## Midterm
One midterm, worth **15%**. Tentatively scheduled for Feb 26.

## Final
No final.
